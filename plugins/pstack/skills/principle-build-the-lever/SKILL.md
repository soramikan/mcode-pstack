# Build the Lever

When the work isn't trivial, build the tool that does it instead of doing it by hand.

A codemod, generator, or script does the work the same way every time and reruns for free. The tool is one artifact a reviewer can read and rerun to check the work. Hand-done changes can only be re-verified by redoing them. A deterministic script turns "trust me" into "run this".

Default to building the lever. Skip it only when the task is trivial, a couple of obvious edits you can see at a glance.

- Do the first unit by hand to learn the recipe, then build the tool. Prove it by rerunning it on that unit and diffing against your hand-done version. Make the lever safe to rerun.
- Codemod or script for edits, generator for repetitive files, a dump-to-sqlite query for analysis, a rerunnable check for verification.
- A deterministic lever beats fan-out. If the tool can process every unit in one pass, run it yourself. Don't fan out delegates to hand-apply what a script can do.
- When you fan work out to subagents, write the lever as a skill they all read: the recipe, the verification contract, and the do-not-touch fences in one artifact. Keep it outside the delegates' write scope so they can't quietly edit the contract.
- Applying this principle produces a file. If you cited it and there is no codemod, script, generator, or delegate skill in the diff, you didn't apply it.
- Preserve the lever when the work outlives the session; commit it only with explicit user authorization.

The bar is triviality, not repetition. A one-off still earns a lever when the lever is what makes the work checkable. Per the [Laziness Protocol](../principle-laziness-protocol/SKILL.md), build the smallest script that does or proves the job, never a framework.

Distinct from [Encode Lessons in Structure](../principle-encode-lessons-in-structure/SKILL.md), which makes a recurring instruction a durable guardrail. This is throughput and reviewability on the work in front of you. For scripting the verification itself, see [Prove It Works](../principle-prove-it-works/SKILL.md).


## MiniMax execution contract

Resolve the package root from this skill's absolute Location (`<package>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`). Resolve bundled scripts and references from that root; never change the caller's cwd to the package. Invoke bundled skills as `/pstack:<name>` or `skill(name="pstack:<name>")`. Frontmatter names remain upstream names.

The parent owns `todowrite`, all delegation, questions, and synthesis. Native `task` accepts only `description` (separate from prompt, 1..50 Unicode characters), `prompt`, `agent_name`, and optional `model`, `effort`, `run_in_background`. Omit model and effort by default (inherit-parent). Use installed `poteto-agent` for scoped playbook implementation or an available general agent for investigation. A child cannot call task, task_append, todo tools, or ask_user. It reports BLOCKED and the smallest question to its parent instead. A child performs its bounded assignment itself; any additional skill workflow requiring delegation becomes a request to the parent, not recursive delegation.

Native tasks share the caller's workspace. Before fan-out the parent assigns disjoint writable paths or serializes writers. A branch name or output directory is not cwd isolation. maxWorkers defaults to 2; queue additional lanes without reducing required coverage. A task_append admission acknowledges queued work, not completion. Track its latest returned task ID and wait for terminal evidence before integrating. Confirm the old writer stopped before replacing it.

Honor host approval and permission gates over upstream autonomy language. No unapproved commit, push, rebase, force operation, merge, external send, tracker update, upload, paid operation, or deletion. Never grant full permissions automatically. In host Plan Mode only the canonical Plan file may be written; collect evidence read-only, and defer prototypes, logs, generated files, and implementation until execution is approved. Do not read or modify another task's Plan.

Use only capabilities actually exposed in this session. `deslop`, `control-ui`, `control-cli`, and `visualize` are not bundled. If neither the dependency nor an appropriate repo driver is available, mark that step NOT_RUN with its reason; never claim it passed. Use the available `skill-creator` capability for skill authoring only when present; otherwise report the authoring dependency unavailable. Missing mandatory validation means BLOCKED, never PASS or permission to merge.

Long-running playbooks execute a bounded turn by default, checkpointing remaining work for manual resume. Only a user-explicitly enabled host Goal may continue autonomously within its limits. The host `/loop` is reserved for CodeRabbit, not a pstack scheduler. Use a wake only when a native cron capability is exposed and the user approved that schedule. Without it, hand back a manual resume point. Do not build a daemon, cloud worker service, watcher-based wake bridge, or event subscription to imitate missing host facilities.
