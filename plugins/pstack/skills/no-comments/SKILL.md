# No comments

Spawn Comment Sicko. Act on accepted findings.

Defer to Comment Sicko's fresh perspective.

## Scope

Use the caller's files or diff. Otherwise use the current diff against the base branch, default `main`, including the working tree.

## Steps

1. Spawn `task` with `agent_name: "comment-sicko"`. Pass the scope. Inherit model and effort unless the user explicitly configured that role; never change suffixes to select speed or reasoning. Do not restate its rules.
2. Inspect its report and diff. Reject application-code edits, scope escapes, exception-protected deletions, misstated `MUST KILL` reasons, and flags that treat kept intentional code as guilty. Reshape flags on our-code surprises stay actionable. Do not restore those comments. A keep survives only with proof it is about something we cannot change. Audit missed scoped lint and TypeScript suppressions. Correctness or safety suppressions stay actionable `MUST KILL`s. Restore deletions only with exact exceptions and scoped proof. Before accepting thin `IMPORTANT` or `do not remove` kills or keeps, run `/pstack:how` or `/pstack:why` on their symbol. If a kill is ambiguous, do not restore. If a keep is refuted or still ambiguous, delete it. Revert and rerun one rejected report with the failure named. Reject a second, report it open, and fail `/pstack:no-comments`.
3. Fix trivial accepted flags directly by deleting a dead path, dropping a parameter, or using the real API. If any fix needs a shape, run `/pstack:architect` once for the accepted set and surrounding code. Stop at the sketch. Architect shapes. Step 4 implements.
4. Implement the smallest root-cause fix in scope. Remove every named workaround. If the root cause is out of scope, land the smallest in-scope fix and report the rest open. The **principle-fix-root-causes** and **principle-redesign-from-first-principles** skills guide intent only. Neither authorizes widening the fence nor fixing instances outside it. Never bolt on symptom guards.
5. Constraint comments say `do not remove`, `do not change wording`, or `talk to X before changing`. Leave keeps about things we cannot change. Offer the cheapest in-scope type, runtime, test, or CI lint. Wait for interactive approval. Unattended and eval require caller pre-approval. If approved, encode then delete. Otherwise delete, report the constraint open, and sketch out-of-scope work.
6. Report the deletion count, restored comments, reruns, architect sketch, fixes, encoding offers, encodings, unenforced constraints, and other open work.


## MiniMax execution contract

Resolve the package root from this skill's absolute Location (`<package>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`). Resolve bundled scripts and references from that root; never change the caller's cwd to the package. Invoke bundled skills as `/pstack:<name>` or `skill(name="pstack:<name>")`. Frontmatter names remain upstream names.

The parent owns `todowrite`, all delegation, questions, and synthesis. Native `task` accepts only `description` (separate from prompt, 1..50 Unicode characters), `prompt`, `agent_name`, and optional `model`, `effort`, `run_in_background`. Omit model and effort by default (inherit-parent). Use installed `poteto-agent` for scoped playbook implementation or an available general agent for investigation. A child cannot call task, task_append, todo tools, or ask_user. It reports BLOCKED and the smallest question to its parent instead. A child performs its bounded assignment itself; any additional skill workflow requiring delegation becomes a request to the parent, not recursive delegation.

Native tasks share the caller's workspace. Before fan-out the parent assigns disjoint writable paths or serializes writers. A branch name or output directory is not cwd isolation. maxWorkers defaults to 2; queue additional lanes without reducing required coverage. A task_append admission acknowledges queued work, not completion. Track its latest returned task ID and wait for terminal evidence before integrating. Confirm the old writer stopped before replacing it.

Honor host approval and permission gates over upstream autonomy language. No unapproved commit, push, rebase, force operation, merge, external send, tracker update, upload, paid operation, or deletion. Never grant full permissions automatically. In host Plan Mode only the canonical Plan file may be written; collect evidence read-only, and defer prototypes, logs, generated files, and implementation until execution is approved. Do not read or modify another task's Plan.

Use only capabilities actually exposed in this session. `deslop`, `control-ui`, `control-cli`, and `visualize` are not bundled. If neither the dependency nor an appropriate repo driver is available, mark that step NOT_RUN with its reason; never claim it passed. Use the available `skill-creator` capability for skill authoring only when present; otherwise report the authoring dependency unavailable. Missing mandatory validation means BLOCKED, never PASS or permission to merge.

Long-running playbooks execute a bounded turn by default, checkpointing remaining work for manual resume. Only a user-explicitly enabled host Goal may continue autonomously within its limits. The host `/loop` is reserved for CodeRabbit, not a pstack scheduler. Use a wake only when a native cron capability is exposed and the user approved that schedule. Without it, hand back a manual resume point. Do not build a daemon, cloud worker service, watcher-based wake bridge, or event subscription to imitate missing host facilities.
